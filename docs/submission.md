# Hakika Hackathon Submission Summary

## Project Overview
Hakika is a decentralized media social network combating misinformation through AGI-driven verification. Built with ASI:One (agentic AI), MeTTa (symbolic logic), uAgents (autonomous workflows), and Cardano (blockchain rewards).

## Key Features
- **AGI Verification**: Posts verified by ASI:One + MeTTa on creation; uAgents refine autonomously.
- **Social Platform**: Feed, niche communities, AGI-assisted drafting.
- **Decentralized Rewards**: Cardano wallet integration for reputation tokens.
- **Tech Stack**: React + Vite frontend, Express + MongoDB backend, Fetch.ai agents.

## AGI Innovation
- **Hybrid AGI**: Neural (ASI:One) + Symbolic (MeTTa) for robust fact-checking.
- **Autonomous Agents**: uAgents handle verification without user intervention.
- **Real-Time Assistance**: AGI suggests improvements during content creation.

## Blockchain Integration
- Cardano wallets (Yoroi/Nami) for auth and rewards.
- Plutus contracts for minting reputation NFTs based on verification scores.

## Demo Flow
1. Connect Cardano wallet.
2. Create post with AGI drafting assist.
3. Post auto-verifies (ASI:One + MeTTa), uAgent refines.
4. View verified feed; earn rewards on-chain.

## Why It Wins
- Aligns with BGI hackathon: AGI + blockchain for agentic economy.
- Solves real problem: Decentralized media integrity.
- Innovative: First social network with full AGI verification stack.

## Team
- Solo developer (AI-assisted).
