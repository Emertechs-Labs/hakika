# Project Roadmap

## Phase 1: MVP (Hackathon)
- [x] Frontend UI/UX basics
- [x] Backend API (posts, auth placeholder)
- [x] Basic agent verification (ASI:One in progress)
- [x] MeTTa symbolic logic integration
- [x] uAgents for autonomous workflows (in progress)
- [x] Cardano wallet integration
- [ ] Demo video

## Current Status (Sprint 1, Week 2)
- **Completed**: Full AGI stack (ASI:One + MeTTa + uAgents), wallet connection, AGI-assisted drafting.
- **Frontend**: React SPA with wallet, feed, create post, AGI drafting.
- **Backend**: Express API with AGI verification, rewards endpoint.
- **Next Optimal Steps**:
  - Finalize uAgents for real refinement.
  - Test full end-to-end flow.
  - Record demo video showcasing AGI + blockchain.
  - Submit to hackathon.

## Phase 2: Enhancement

- [ ] Agentverse marketplace
- [ ] Gamification features
- [ ] Mobile app

## Phase 3: Scale
- [ ] IPFS media storage

- [ ] Community governance

## Milestones
- Dec 2025: Hackathon submission (focus on AGI demo)
- Jan 2026: Beta release
- Feb 2026: Full launch

## Risks
- API rate limits (mitigate: caching, mocks)
- AGI accuracy (test with diverse content)
- Blockchain gas fees (use testnet)

## Metrics
- User engagement: Posts created, verification scores
- AGI performance: Response time, accuracy %
- On-chain transactions: Rewards minted
