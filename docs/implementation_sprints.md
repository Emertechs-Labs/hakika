# Hakika Implementation Sprints: Areas Still to Be Implemented

This document outlines a sprint-based plan for implementing the remaining features in Hakika, prioritized by AI focus and frontend needs. Each feature is broken into user stories with story points (effort estimates using Fibonacci scale: 1=trivial, 2=small, 3=medium, 5=large, 8=xlarge, 13=epic). Sprints are 2 weeks each, assuming a small team (1-2 devs).

## Sprint Progress
- **Sprint 2 Started**: October 21, 2025 - Frontend Polish & Gamification.
- **Current Focus**: Theming (Completed) - Added multiple theme options (light, dark, blue, green, purple) with theme selector.
- **Sprint 2 Complete!** All stories implemented. Ready for Sprint 3.

## Sprint Planning Assumptions
- **Prioritization**: AI core first, then frontend polish, mobile/PWA, UI/UX, and other gaps.
- **Dependencies**: AI features may require backend changes; frontend needs API readiness.
- **Testing**: Each story includes basic unit/e2e tests.
- **Total Story Points**: ~100 across 3 sprints (realistic for MVP extension).
- **Velocity**: Assume 20-30 points per sprint.

## Sprint 1: AI Core Enhancement (Focus: Agentic Verification & Autonomy)
**Goal**: Strengthen AI as the heart of Hakika with real MeTTa, autonomous agents, and proactive features.  
**Total Points**: 32  
**Duration**: 2 weeks  

### AI-Related Stories
- **Full MeTTa Integration** (13 points): Replace mock MeTTa with real bindings for symbolic reasoning (logical proofs, consensus). Integrate into verification pipeline.  
  - Acceptance: Agents use MeTTa for advanced checks; accuracy >80% on test data.
- **uAgents Autonomy** (8 points): Make agents event-driven (WebSockets/polling for new posts). Implement multi-agent consensus (voting) and auto-mint rewards on-chain.  
  - Acceptance: Agents trigger automatically; consensus updates DB/blockchain.
- **Agentverse Marketplace** (5 points): Integrate marketplace for agent discovery/deployment. Allow user-selectable agents.  
  - Acceptance: UI shows agent options; users can deploy custom agents.
- **Proactive AI Features** (5 points): Add auto-flagging misinformation, personalized suggestions, predictive scores.  
  - Acceptance: Posts auto-flag; users see tailored content.
- **AI Testing/Accuracy** (3 points): Add metrics (accuracy, response time) and fallbacks for API failures.  
  - Acceptance: Dashboard shows AI stats; graceful degradation.

### Frontend Integration Stories
- **Real-Time Updates** (5 points): Implement WebSockets (Socket.io) for live verification status and post updates.  
  - Acceptance: UI updates instantly without refresh.
- **Enhanced AI UX** (3 points): Allow editing AI suggestions, viewing reasoning, challenging decisions.  
  - Acceptance: Interactive feedback loop in drafting/verification.

## Sprint 2: Frontend Polish & Gamification
**Goal**: Improve user experience with gamification, better auth, and mobile readiness.  
**Total Points**: 28  
**Duration**: 2 weeks  

### Frontend Integration Stories
- **Gamification UI** (8 points): Add badges, reputation meters, leaderboards, interactive verification games (user votes).  
  - Acceptance: Users earn/see rewards; voting affects scores.
- **Wallet/Auth Polish** (3 points): Improve Web3 integration (error handling, wallet switching).  
  - Acceptance: Seamless auth; clear error messages.

### Mobile & PWA Stories
- **Mobile Optimization** (5 points): Add mobile styles (touch targets, swipe), test responsiveness.  
  - Acceptance: 100% mobile-friendly; passes Lighthouse mobile audit.
- **PWA Setup** (5 points): Create `public/manifest.json` and `public/sw.js` for installation/offline.  
  - Acceptance: App installable; works offline with cached data.
- **Progressive Enhancement** (3 points): Enable offline mode with cached posts/verifications.  
  - Acceptance: Core features work without internet.

### UI/UX Improvements Stories
- **Animations & Interactions** (5 points): Add Framer Motion for transitions, hovers, loading animations.  
  - Acceptance: Smooth, engaging interactions.
- **Accessibility** (3 points): Add ARIA labels, keyboard nav, screen reader support.  
  - Acceptance: Passes WCAG AA standards.
- **Advanced Components** (5 points): Implement modals, infinite scroll, search/filtering.  
  - Acceptance: Better navigation; scalable feeds.
- **Theming** (3 points): Expand themes (custom colors); ensure niche consistency.  
  - Acceptance: Dynamic themes; consistent across pages.

## Sprint 3: Advanced Features & Polish
**Goal**: Add decentralized storage, testing, and security for a robust product.  
**Total Points**: 25  
**Duration**: 2 weeks  

### Other Gaps Stories
- **IPFS Integration** (8 points): Implement decentralized media storage (replace local uploads).  
  - Acceptance: Media stored on IPFS; links in posts.
- **Testing** (5 points): Add e2e tests for AI flows, mobile/PWA.  
  - Acceptance: 80% test coverage; CI/CD passes.
- **Security** (5 points): Add rate limiting for AI APIs, user privacy measures.  
  - Acceptance: Protected against abuse; GDPR-compliant.
- **Demo & Documentation** (5 points): Record demo video; update docs for new features.  
  - Acceptance: Hackathon-ready submission; clear guides.
- **Bug Fixes & Refinement** (2 points): Address any issues from prior sprints.  
  - Acceptance: Stable, polished MVP.

## Overall Timeline & Milestones
- **End of Sprint 1**: AI-driven verification fully autonomous; real-time UI.
- **End of Sprint 2**: Gamified, mobile/PWA-ready app with modern UX.
- **End of Sprint 3**: Decentralized, secure, tested product.
- **Total Time**: 6 weeks. Adjust based on team size/velocity.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **AI API Limits**: Cache responses; use mocks for dev.
- **Blockchain Costs**: Stick to testnet; optimize transactions.
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to story points; prioritize AI.

This plan builds on the current codebase. If needed, break stories into subtasks or adjust points.
